		  these girls are probably your age or younger! How did they get started? Research the kinds of things they did to start making an impact on the world.

		  Try to get in contact with a representive or branch in your area. Normally, these are listed on the website of the organization. You can follow <a href="https://activistfacts.com/organizations/">
		  this link</a> to look up a few. Do you feel a connection with any of them? Do you have a reason to fight for that movement?
